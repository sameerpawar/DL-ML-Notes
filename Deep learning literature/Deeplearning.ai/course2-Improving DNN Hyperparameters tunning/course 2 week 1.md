# C2W1L01: Train/dev/test sets
1. Applied ML is highly iterative process
    - Idea->Experiment->Code->Idea
1. train/dev/test ~ 60/20/20 if data is small. In case of big data it is possible to have 98/1/1.
1. Mismatched train/test distribution
    - make sure that dev/test come from same distribution.
